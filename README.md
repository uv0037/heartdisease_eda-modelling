# heartdisease_eda-modelling

This repository analyzes the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and comparing the predictive performance of several machine learning models.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Cleveland Heart Disease Database
- **Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key features and trends related to heart disease.
- **Modelling**: Comparison of three machine learning algorithms:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
- Statistical analysis and visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison using Scikit-learn
- Performance visualization ([Barplot comparison](Barplot_comp.PNG))

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/uv0037/heartdisease_eda-modelling.git
   cd heartdisease_eda-modelling
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   This project uses Python 3 and the following main libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - seaborn
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn

   Install them with:

   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**

   Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```
   heart-disease-eda-and-modelling.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Review the EDA section for insights on feature distributions and correlations.
- Compare the predictive performance of KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM models in the notebook.
- Visualize results using the provided barplot.

## Results

Model performance is summarized in the notebook and illustrated in the `Barplot_comp.PNG` file.
